22,Daniel (Dong Hyun) Kang,donghyun.kang22@gmail.com,True,761091,"I have already contributed a few write-ups to WCH, specifically on Korean history, but I believe that the process of reviewing and fact-checking is just as important as contributing, since the readers of WCH would need information that is not only interesting and deals with history from working class perspectives, but is also factual and accurate. Thanks to my undergraduate and postgraduate studies at an academically rigorous institution like Oxford, I am highly experienced in revising and proofreading, and I would like to put my skills to good use for WCH.","I have graduated from the University of Oxford in 2022 with a Bachelor of Arts in Modern Languages (French) and Linguistics, attaining First Class Honours (equivalent to a 4.0 GPA). I went on to do postgraduate studies at the same institution, graduating in 2023 with a Master of Studies in Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics, winning a prize for the best performance in my cohort. As I am currently doing my military service in South Korea, I am not legally allowed to be a member of any political organisation or union.",11/01/2024,
